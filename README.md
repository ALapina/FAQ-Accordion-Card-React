## ðŸ“š About the Project:

- This project is variation of my other project - [faq accordion](https://github.com/ALapina/FAQ-Accordion-Card---JavaScript).
- Html and CSS here is the same, but this project is build using React with Hooks. In this version I made it so only one answer can be in open state.
